# jshelled
`jshelled` is a command-line wrapper program to run [jshell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JShell) with the classpath of a Gradle project detected by your current directory. If your current directory does not contain a Gradle project, then `jshelled` operates as a normal `jshell` call.

## Setup
1. `git clone git@github.com:gravitation1/jshelled.git`
2. Copy the `jshelled` file to your `$PATH`.
3. Go to a Gradle project and run `jshelled`.
